# Group3 - Full Stack App:
In this application we want a user to perform various operations like create, read, update and delete on the various quests that we create. 

## Overview:
In this application we can see two colors where if user touches the first color the user will get a treasure location. When user touches the second color it will check whether the user is near to the location or not and then if user is far from the location then it will give a clue to help the user. If user is near to the location then it will notify the Congrats message.
